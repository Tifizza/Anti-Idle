# Anti-Idle
This script detects if you are idle for the amount of time specified on the constant IDLE_TIME, and then presses 'ctrl' to get you out of 'idle' state so you can always be online on whatever app you use (Teams, Slack, Discord, ... )

This will work only on Windows, feel free to commit any changes
